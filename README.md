# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
Louise created a file to track her project campaign. The file contains thousands of crowdfunding projects. I will provide her key data insights, and visualize different trends.

### Explain the purpose of this analysis.
 I will analyze the kickstarter data to see if her kickstarter goals and pledged outcomes were met. I will check to see if there are trends due to the country, category, or date.
